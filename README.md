## Blackjack in Python 

1) I created a basic game of Blackjack in Python that satisfied test scenarios using TDD

2) I also extended the game further in a separate file (extended_play_blackjack) to include further gameplay/interactivity including:
 - Interaction with player and invites input
 - Displaying player cards and dealers opening card
 - Player vs Dealer gameplay
 - Deciding a winner
 - Resetting the deck for a new game
